Being raised in Greece he had experienced many of their native flavors and cooking techniques. When his family made the move to the United States he could no longer find a place that served food with the same spazaz, So he went out to start a restaraunt that could deliver the taste of his original home to his new home. After countless hours in the in the kitchen he was able to create his menu and open his restaraunt, Classic greek. his passion and love for the food and sharing it with other people for them to enjoy led to even greated success then he ever expected and after 8 years in buisness he opened up his second location. wanting to continue spreading the great taste of home he later went on to expand his buisness further and become a country-wide franchise.
